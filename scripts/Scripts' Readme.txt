Navigate to the script in terminal then type:
chmod +x <name-of-script>.sh
	[This allows the script to be ran as an executable file]
. ./compileMota.sh 
	[don't forget to add a '.' before running ./compileMota]

As an example:

cd /home/user1/MotaCoin/scripts/   
	[Change directory to the scripts location.] 
	[They can be moved out of the original folder and still work fine.]
ls -a   
	[Make sure the file is here]
chmod +x installMotaDep.sh
. ./installMotaDep.sh
*type in password for sudo access*

Then you are done. Watch it fly.
